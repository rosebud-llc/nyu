# lab2: scheduler

Unfortunately, I fell sick with covid the last two weeks
and was unable to work on the final portion of the assignment
by creating the scheduler class objects. You'll find 
all other components have been implements, such as
arg parsing, chronologically sorted events, run queue, and more.

# build
`make`

# run

# test
